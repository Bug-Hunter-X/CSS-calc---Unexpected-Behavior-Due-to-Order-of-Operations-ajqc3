The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you don't handle the order of operations and different unit types correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a width property works as expected, but `calc(10px - 100%)` will result in an unexpected outcome because the calculation is performed from left to right, and percentages depend on the context of where they are used.
