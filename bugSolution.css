The solution involves understanding that `calc()` performs operations from left to right. If you subtract a percentage from a pixel value (or vice-versa), the calculation may not produce your expected results. To resolve this, always ensure that the percentage value is calculated relative to the correct context and that the operations are ordered correctly. For this specific example, you would use `calc(100% - 10px)` rather than `calc(10px - 100%)`.
